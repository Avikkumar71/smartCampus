            <h2>Why is Ethereum Finance needed</h2>
            <p id = "about">
                Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain-based software that has smart contract functionality. 
                <br><br>Ethereum is open source and used primarily to support the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world known as Ether.
                 Ethereum enables the smart contracts and applications built on its blockchain to run smoothly without fraud, downtime, control, or any third-party interference.
                <br><br>Ethereum is also a programming language that helps developers to create distributed applications. 
                One of the major projects with Ethereum is Microsoft's partnership with ConsenSys offering 
                Ethereum Blockchain as a Service on Microsoft Azure to enable developers and enterprise clients to have a single click blockchain developer environment that is cloud-based.
                Ethereum split into two different blockchains in 2016 namely Ethereum, and Ethereum Classic. This was due to a hack earlier that year in which the hacker made away with $50 million Ether.
                The hacker took advantage of a third-party project flaw and exploited a DOA (a smart contract set originating from the Ethereum platform).<br><br>
